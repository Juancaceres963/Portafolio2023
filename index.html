          <p>
            Before dedicating myself to programming, from an early age I started
            working every school vacation, I always found myself doing some work
            related to gastronomy, and little by little I liked it more and
            more. I have completed culinary careers in Venezuela (country where
            I was born and raised until I was 19 years old) and in Argentina
            (where I have lived since I left Venezuela). My more than 6 years of
            complete experience in the gastronomic field left me many lessons
            that I am grateful for today, since with all this experience in this
            very strong field I was able to develop valuable skills to be able
            to carry out any job I want. dedicate myself in the future. At a
            young age and starting from the bottom I was able to lead an entire
            kitchen team thanks to how committed and responsible I have always
            been to my work. I got a job in important places and I have
            participated in multiple private events. I am telling all this so
            that it is understood that I have skills such as teamwork, effective
            communication, problem solving, proactivity and labor intelligence,
            and without less respect, honesty and responsibility are values that
            define me as a person.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, and thanks to a family member who works as a programmer, I
            can dedicate myself exclusively to learning programming during more
            than a year of intensive studies from home, spending more than 8
            hours a day during all this time, I have learned everything I know.
            about today. these languages that are read by machines. As I have
            always had an "Artistic" side, we decided to focus on learning
            everything a good front-end developer should know, I specialize in
            HTML, CCS, JavaScript and React, as well as knowing many libraries
            and Frameworks. I know that learning in this field never ends, and I
            have no problem with that, educating myself and being curious about
            everything related to this world was one of the things that my
            family member also taught me. I like to create, give style and
            dynamism to websites and applications, make animations and play with
            colors, shapes and images. I have great aspirations as a programmer
            and I know that with the passage of time I will be able to achieve
            them.
